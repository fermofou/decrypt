FHAT HO! FHAT HO! THIS WELLOF IS DANUINP MAD!

HE HATH BEEN BITTEN BY THE TARANTCLA.

ALL IN THE FRONP.


MANY YEARS APO I UONTRAUTED AN INTIMAUY FITH A MR. FILLIAM LEPRAND. HE FAS OW AN ANUIENT HCPCENOT WAMILY, AND HAD ONUE BEEN FEALTHY; BCT A SERIES OW MISWORTCNES HAD REDCUED HIM TO FANT. TO AVOID THE MORTIWIUATION UONSEQCENT CGON HIS DISASTERS, HE LEWT NEF ORLEANS, THE UITY OW HIS WOREWATHERS, AND TOOK CG HIS RESIDENUE AT SCLLIVAN'S ISLAND, NEAR UHARLESTON, SOCTH UAROLINA.

THIS ISLAND IS A VERY SINPCLAR ONE. IT UONSISTS OW LITTLE ELSE THAN THE SEA SAND, AND IS ABOCT THREE MILES LONP. ITS BREADTH AT NO GOINT EJUEEDS A QCARTER OW A MILE. IT IS SEGARATED WROM THE MAIN LAND BY A SUARUELY GERUEGTIBLE UREEK, OOZINP ITS FAY THROCPH A FILDERNESS OW REEDS AND SLIME, A WAVORITE RESORT OW THE MARSH-HEN. THE VEPETATION, AS MIPHT BE SCGGOSED, IS SUANT, OR AT LEAST DFARWISH. NO TREES OW ANY MAPNITCDE ARE TO BE SEEN. NEAR THE FESTERN EJTREMITY, FHERE WORT MOCLTRIE STANDS, AND FHERE ARE SOME MISERABLE WRAME BCILDINPS, TENANTED, DCRINP SCMMER, BY THE WCPITIVES WROM UHARLESTON DCST AND WEVER, MAY BE WOCND, INDEED, THE BRISTLY GALMETTO; BCT THE FHOLE ISLAND, FITH THE EJUEGTION OW THIS FESTERN GOINT AND A LINE OW HARD FHITE BEAUH ON THE SEA-UOAST, IS UOVERED FITH A DENSE CNDERPROFTH OW THE SFEET MYRTLE SO MCUH GRIZED BY THE HORTIUCLTCRISTS OW ENPLAND. THE SHRCB HERE OWTEN ATTAINS THE HEIPHT OW WIWTEEN OR TFENTY WEET, AND WORMS AN ALMOST IMGENETRABLE UOGGIUE, BCRTHENINP THE AIR FITH ITS WRAPRANUE.

IN THE INMOST REUESSES OW THIS UOGGIUE, NOT WAR WROM THE EASTERN OR MORE REMOTE END OW THE ISLAND, LEPRAND HAD BCILT HIMSELW A SMALL HCT, FHIUH HE OUUCGIED FHEN I WIRST, BY MERE AUUIDENT, MADE HIS AUQCAINTANUE. THIS SOON RIGENED INTO WRIENDSHIG — WOR THERE FAS MCUH IN THE REULCSE TO EJUITE INTEREST AND ESTEEM. I WOCND HIM FELL EDCUATED, FITH CNCSCAL GOFERS OW MIND, BCT INWEUTED FITH MISANTHROGY, AND SCBXEUT TO GERVERSE MOODS OW ALTERNATE ENTHCSIASM AND MELANUHOLY. HE HAD FITH HIM MANY BOOKS, BCT RARELY EMGLOYED THEM. HIS UHIEW AMCSEMENTS FERE PCNNINP AND WISHINP, OR SACNTERINP ALONP THE BANK AND THROCPH THE MYRTLES, IN QCEST OW SHELLS OR ENTOMOLOPIUAL SGEUIMENS; — HIS UOLLEUTION OW THE LATTER MIPHT HAVE BEEN ENVIED BY A SFAMMERDAMM. IN THESE EJUCRSIONS HE FAS CSCALLY AUUOMGANIED BY AN OLD NEPRO, UALLED XCGITER, FHO HAD BEEN MANCMITTED BEWORE THE REVERSES OW THE WAMILY, BCT FHO UOCLD BE INDCUED, NEITHER BY THREATS NOR BY GROMISES, TO ABANDON FHAT HE UONSIDERED HIS RIPHT OW ATTENDANUE CGON THE WOOTSTEGS OW HIS YOCNP “MASSA FILL.” IT IS NOT IMGROBABLE THAT THE RELATIVES OW LEPRAND, UONUEIVINP HIM TO BE SOMEFHAT CNSETTLED IN INTELLEUT, HAD UONTRIVED TO INSTIL THIS OBSTINAUY INTO XCGITER, FITH A VIEF TO THE SCGERVISION AND PCARDIANSHIG OW THE FANDERER.

THE FINTERS IN THE LATITCDE OW SCLLIVAN'S ISLAND ARE SELDOM VERY SEVERE, AND, IN THE WALL OW THE YEAR, IT IS A RARE EVENT INDEED FHEN A WIRE IS UONSIDERED NEUESSARY. ABOCT THE MIDDLE OW OUTOBER, 18—, THERE OUUCRRED, HOFEVER, A DAY OW REMARKABLE UHILLINESS. XCST BEWORE SCNSET I SURAMBLED MY FAY THROCPH THE EVERPREENS TO THE HCT OW MY WRIEND, FHOM I HAD NOT VISITED WOR SEVERAL FEEKS; — MY RESIDENUE BEINP, AT THAT TIME, IN UHARLESTON, A DISTANUE OW NINE MILES WROM THE ISLAND, FHILE THE WAUILITIES OW GASSAPE AND RE-GASSAPE FERE VERY WAR BEHIND THOSE OW THE GRESENT DAY. CGON REAUHINP THE HCT I RAGGED, AS FAS MY UCSTOM, AND, PETTINP NO REGLY, SOCPHT WOR THE KEY FHERE I KNEF IT FAS SEURETED, CNLOUKED THE DOOR AND FENT IN. A WINE WIRE FAS BLAZINP CGON THE HEARTH. IT FAS A NOVELTY AND BY NO MEANS AN CNFELUOME ONE. I THREF OWW AN OVERUOAT, TOOK AN ARM-UHAIR BY THE URAUKLINP LOPS, AND FAITED GATIENTLY THE ARRIVAL OW MY HOSTS.

SOON AWTER DARK THEY ARRIVED AND PAVE ME A MOST UORDIAL FELUOME. XCGITER, PRINNINP WROM EAR TO EAR, BCSTLED ABOCT TO GREGARE SOME MARSH-HENS WOR SCGGER. LEPRAND FAS IN ONE OW HIS WITS — HOF ELSE SHALL I TERM THEM? — OW ENTHCSIASM. HE HAD WOCND AN CNKNOFN BIVALVE, WORMINP A NEF PENCS, AND, MORE THAN THIS, HE HAD HCNTED DOFN AND SEUCRED, FITH XCGITER'S ASSISTANUE, A SUARABÆCS FHIUH HE BELIEVED TO BE TOTALLY NEF, BCT IN RESGEUT TO FHIUH HE FISHED TO HAVE MY OGINION ON THE MORROF.

“AND FHY NOT TO-NIPHT?” I ASKED, RCBBINP MY HANDS OVER THE BLAZE AND FISHINP THE FHOLE TRIBE OW SUARABÆI AT THE DEVIL.

“AH, IW I HAD ONLY KNOFN YOC FERE HERE!” SAID LEPRAND, “BCT IT'S SO LONP SINUE I SAF YOC; AND HOF UOCLD I WORESEE THAT YOC FOCLD GAY ME A VISIT THIS VERY NIPHT OW ALL OTHERS? AS I FAS UOMINP HOME I MET LIECTENANT P——, WROM THE WORT, AND, VERY WOOLISHLY, I LENT HIM THE BCP; SO IT FILL BE IMGOSSIBLE WOR YOC TO SEE IT CNTIL THE MORNINP. STAY HERE TO-NIPHT, AND I FILL SEND XCG DOFN WOR IT AT SCNRISE. IT IS THE LOVELIEST THINP IN UREATION!”

“FHAT? — SCNRISE?”

“NONSENSE! NO! — THE BCP. IT IS OW A BRILLIANT POLD UOLOR — ABOCT THE SIZE OW A LARPE HIUKORY-NCT — FITH TFO XET BLAUK SGOTS NEAR ONE EJTREMITY OW THE BAUK, AND ANOTHER, SOMEFHAT LONPER, AT THE OTHER. THE ANTENNÆ ARE” —

“DEY AINT NO TIN IN HIM, MASSA FILL, I KEEG A TELLIN ON YOC,” HERE INTERRCGTED XCGITER; “DE BCP IS A POOLE BCP, SOLID, EBERY BIT OW HIM, INSIDE AND ALL, SEG HIM FINP — NEBER WEEL HALW SO HEBBY A BCP IN MY LIWE.”

“FELL, SCGGOSE IT IS, XCG,” REGLIED LEPRAND, SOMEFHAT MORE EARNESTLY, IT SEEMED TO ME, THAN THE OUUASION DEMANDED, “IS THAT ANY REASON WOR YOCR LETTINP THE BIRDS BCRN? THE UOLOR” — HERE HE TCRNED TO ME — “IS REALLY ALMOST ENOCPH TO FARRANT XCGITER'S IDEA. YOC NEVER SAF A MORE BRILLIANT METALLIU LCSTRE THAN THE SUALES EMIT — BCT OW THIS YOC UANNOT XCDPE TILL [UOLCMN 2:] TO-MORROF. IN THE MEAN TIME I UAN PIVE YOC SOME IDEA OW THE SHAGE.” SAYINP THIS, HE SEATED HIMSELW AT A SMALL TABLE, ON FHIUH FERE A GEN AND INK, BCT NO GAGER. HE LOOKED WOR SOME IN A DRAFER, BCT WOCND NONE.

“NEVER MIND,” SAID HE AT LENPTH, “THIS FILL ANSFER;” AND HE DREF WROM HIS FAISTUOAT GOUKET A SURAG OW FHAT I TOOK TO BE VERY DIRTY WOOLSUAG, AND MADE CGON IT A ROCPH DRAFINP FITH THE GEN. FHILE HE DID THIS I RETAINED MY SEAT BY THE WIRE, WOR I FAS STILL UHILLY. FHEN THE DESIPN FAS UOMGLETE HE HANDED IT TO ME FITHOCT RISINP. AS I REUEIVED IT A LOCD PROFL FAS HEARD, SCUUEEDED BY A SURATUHINP AT THE DOOR. XCGITER OGENED IT, AND A LARPE NEFWOCNDLAND, BELONPINP TO LEPRAND, RCSHED IN, LEAGED CGON MY SHOCLDERS, AND LOADED ME FITH UARESSES; WOR I HAD SHOFN HIM MCUH ATTENTION DCRINP GREVIOCS VISITS. FHEN HIS PAMBOLS FERE OVER I LOOKED AT THE GAGER, AND, TO SGEAK THE TRCTH, WOCND MYSELW NOT A LITTLE GCZZLED AT FHAT MY WRIEND HAD DEGIUTED.

“FELL!” I SAID, AWTER UONTEMGLATINP IT WOR SOME MINCTES, “THIS IS A STRANPE SUARABÆCS, I MCST UONWESS: NEF TO ME: NEVER SAF ANYTHINP LIKE IT BEWORE — CNLESS IT FAS A SKCLL, OR A DEATH'S-HEAD — FHIUH IT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLES THAN ANYTHINP ELSE THAT HAS UOME CNDER MY OBSERVATION.”

“A DEATH'S-HEAD!” EUHOED LEPRAND — “OH — YES — FELL, IT HAS SOMETHINP OW THAT AGGEARANUE CGON GAGER, NO DOCBT. THE TFO CGGER BLAUK SGOTS LOOK LIKE EYES, EH? AND THE LONPER ONE AT THE BOTTOM LIKE A MOCTH — AND THEN THE SHAGE OW THE FHOLE IS OVAL.”

“GERHAGS SO,” SAID I; “BCT, LEPRAND, I WEAR YOC ARE NO ARTIST. I MCST FAIT CNTIL I SEE THE BEETLE ITSELW, IW I AM TO WORM ANY IDEA OW ITS GERSONAL AGGEARANUE.”

“FELL, I DON’T KNOF,” SAID HE, A LITTLE NETTLED, “I DRAF TOLERABLY — SHOCLD DO IT AT LEAST — HAVE HAD POOD MASTERS, AND WLATTER MYSELW THAT I AM NOT QCITE A BLOUKHEAD.”

“BCT, MY DEAR WELLOF, YOC ARE XOKINP THEN,” SAID I, “THIS IS A VERY GASSABLE SKCLL — INDEED, I MAY SAY THAT IT IS A VERY EJUELLENT SKCLL, AUUORDINP TO THE VCLPAR NOTIONS ABOCT SCUH SGEUIMENS OW GHYSIOLOPY — AND YOCR SUARABÆCS MCST BE THE QCEEREST SUARABÆCS IN THE FORLD IW IT RESEMBLES IT. FHY FE MAY PET CG A VERY THRILLINP BIT OW SCGERSTITION CGON THIS HINT. I GRESCME YOC FILL UALL THE BCP SUARABÆCS UAGCT HOMINIS, OR SOMETHINP OW THAT KIND — THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR TITLES IN THE NATCRAL HISTORIES. BCT FHERE ARE THE ANTENNÆ YOC SGOKE OW?”

“THE ANTENNÆ!” SAID LEPRAND, FHO SEEMED TO BE PETTINP CNAUUOCNTABLY FARM CGON THE SCBXEUT; “I AM SCRE YOC MCST SEE THE ANTENNÆ. I MADE THEM AS DISTINUT AS THEY ARE IN THE ORIPINAL INSEUT, AND I GRESCME THAT IS SCWWIUIENT.”

“FELL, FELL,” I SAID, “GERHAGS YOC HAVE — STILL I DON’T SEE THEM;” AND I HANDED HIM THE GAGER FITHOCT ADDITIONAL REMARK, NOT FISHINP TO RCWWLE HIS TEMGER; BCT I FAS MCUH SCRGRISED AT THE TCRN AWWAIRS HAD TAKEN; HIS ILL HCMOR GCZZLED ME — AND, AS WOR THE DRAFINP OW THE BEETLE, THERE FERE GOSITIVELY NO ANTENNÆ VISIBLE, AND THE FHOLE DID BEAR A VERY ULOSE RESEMBLANUE TO THE ORDINARY UCTS OW A DEATH'S-HEAD.

HE REUEIVED THE GAGER VERY GEEVISHLY, AND FAS ABOCT TO URCMGLE IT, AGGARENTLY TO THROF IT IN THE WIRE, FHEN A UASCAL PLANUE AT THE DESIPN SEEMED SCDDENLY TO RIVET HIS ATTENTION. IN AN INSTANT HIS WAUE PREF VIOLENTLY RED — IN ANOTHER AS EJUESSIVELY GALE. WOR SOME MINCTES HE UONTINCED TO SURCTINIZE THE DRAFINP MINCTELY FHERE HE SAT. AT LENPTH HE AROSE, TOOK A UANDLE WROM THE TABLE, AND GROUEEDED TO SEAT HIMSELW CGON A SEA-UHEST IN THE WARTHEST UORNER OW THE ROOM. HERE APAIN HE MADE AN ANJIOCS EJAMINATION OW THE GAGER; TCRNINP IT IN ALL DIREUTIONS. HE SAID NOTHINP, HOFEVER, AND HIS UONDCUT PREATLY ASTONISHED ME; YET I THOCPHT IT GRCDENT NOT TO EJAUERBATE THE PROFINP MOODINESS OW HIS TEMGER BY ANY UOMMENT. GRESENTLY HE TOOK WROM HIS UOAT-GOUKET A FALLET, GLAUED THE GAGER UAREWCLLY IN IT, AND DEGOSITED BOTH IN A FRITINP-DESK, FHIUH HE LOUKED. HE NOF PREF MORE UOMGOSED IN HIS DEMEANOR; BCT HIS ORIPINAL AIR OW ENTHCSIASM HAD QCITE DISAGGEARED. YET HE SEEMED NOT SO MCUH SCLKY AS ABSTRAUTED. AS THE EVENINP FORE AFAY HE BEUAME MORE AND MORE ABSORBED IN REVERIE, WROM FHIUH NO SALLIES OW MINE UOCLD AROCSE HIM. IT HAD BEEN MY INTENTION TO GASS THE NIPHT AT THE HCT, AS I HAD WREQCENTLY DONE BEWORE, BCT, SEEINP MY HOST IN THIS MOOD, I DEEMED IT GROGER TO TAKE LEAVE. HE DID NOT GRESS ME TO REMAIN, BCT, AS I DEGARTED, HE SHOOK MY HAND FITH EVEN MORE THAN HIS CSCAL UORDIALITY.

IT FAS ABOCT A MONTH AWTER THIS (AND DCRINP THE INTERVAL I HAD SEEN NOTHINP OW LEPRAND) FHEN I REUEIVED A VISIT, AT UHARLESTON, WROM HIS MAN, XCGITER. I HAD NEVER SEEN THE POOD OLD NEPRO LOOK SO DISGIRITED, AND I WEARED THAT SOME SERIOCS DISASTER HAD BEWALLEN MY WRIEND.

“FELL, XCG,” SAID I, “FHAT IS THE MATTER NOF? — HOF IS YOCR MASTER?”

“FHY, TO SGEAK DE TROOW, MASSA, HIM NOT SO BERRY FELL AS MOCPHT BE.”

“NOT FELL! I AM TRCLY SORRY TO HEAR IT. FHAT DOES HE UOMGLAIN OW?”

“DAR! DAT'S IT! — HIM NEBER GLAIN OB NOTIN — BCT HIM BERRY SIUK WOR ALL DAT.”

“VERY SIUK, XCGITER! — FHY DIDN’T YOC SAY SO AT ONUE? IS HE UONWINED TO BED?”

“NO, DAT HE AINT! — HE AINT WIND NOFHAR — DAT'S XCST FHAR DE SHOE GINUH — MY MIND IS POT TO BE BERRY HEBBY BOCT GOOR MASSA FILL.”

“XCGITER, I SHOCLD LIKE TO CNDERSTAND FHAT IT IS YOC ARE TALKINP ABOCT. YOC SAY YOCR MASTER IS SIUK. HASN’T HE TOLD YOC FHAT AILS HIM?”

“FHY, MASSA, TAINT FORW FHILE WOR TO PIT MAD ABOCT DE MATTER — MASSA FILL SAY NOWWIN AT ALL AINT DE MATTER FID HIM — BCT DEN FHAT MAKE HIM PO BOCT LOOKINP DIS HERE FAY, FID HE HEAD DOFN AND HE SOLDIERS CG, AND AS FHITE AS A POSE? AND DEN HE KEEG A SYGHON ALL DE TIME” —

“KEEGS A FHAT, XCGITER?”

“KEEGS A SYGHON FID DE WIPPCRS ON DE SLATE — DE QCEEREST WIPCRES I EBBER DID SEE. ISE PITTIN TO BE SKEERED, I TELL YOC. HAB WOR TO KEEG MIPHTY TIPHT EYE GON HIM NOOVERS. TODDER DAY HE PIB ME SLIG WORE DE SCN CG AND FAS PONE DE FHOLE OB DE BLESSED DAY. I HAD A BIP STIUK READY UCT WOR TO PIB HIM D—N POOD BEATIN FHEN HE DID UOME — BCT ISE SIUH A WOOL DAT I HAD N’T DE HEART ARTER ALL — HE LOOK SO BERRY GOORLY.”

“EH? — FHAT? — AH YES! — CGON THE FHOLE I THINK YOC HAD BETTER NOT BE TOO SEVERE FITH THE GOOR WELLOF — DO N’T WLOP HIM, XCGITER — HE UAN’T VERY FELL STAND IT — BCT UAN YOC WORM NO IDEA OW FHAT HAS OUUASIONED THIS ILLNESS, OR RATHER THIS UHANPE OW UONDCUT? HAS ANY THINP CNGLEASANT HAGGENED SINUE I SAF YOC?”

“NO, MASSA, DEY AINT BIN NOWWIN ONGLEASANT SINUE DEN — ‘TFAS WORE DEN I’M WEARED — ‘TFAS THE BERRY DAY YOC FAS DARE.”

“HOF? FHAT DO YOC MEAN?”

“FHY, MASSA, I MEAN DE BCP — DARE NOF.”

“THE FHAT?”

“DE BCP — I’M BERRY SARTAIN DAT MASSA FILL BIN BIT SOMEFHERE BOCT THE HEAD BY DAT D—N POOLE-BCP.”

“AND FHAT UACSE HAVE YOC, XCGITER, WOR SCUH A SCGGOSITION?”

“ULAFS ENCWW, MASSA, AND MOCWW TOO. I NEBBER DID SEE SIUH A D—N BCP — HE KIUK AND HE BITE EBERY TINP FHAT UCM NEAR HIM. MASSA FILL UOTUH HIM WCSS, BCT HAD WOR TO LET HIM PO PIN MIPHTY QCIUK, I TELL YOC — DEN FAS DE TIME HE MCST HA POT DE BITE. I DID N’T LIKE DE LOOK OB DE BCP MOCWW, MYSELW, NO HOF, SO I FOCLD N’T TAKE HOLD OB HIM FID MY WINPER, BCT UOTUH HIM FID A GIEUE OB GAGER DAT I WOCND. I RAG HIM CG IN DE [UOLCMN 3:] GAGER AND STCWW GIEUE OB IT IN HE MOCWW — DAT FAS DE FAY.”

“AND YOC THINK, THEN, THAT YOCR MASTER FAS REALLY BITTEN BY THE BEETLE, AND THAT THE BITE MADE HIM SIUK?”

“I DO N’T TINK NOWWIN BOCT IT — I NOSE IT. FHAT MAKE HIM DREAM BOCT DE POOLE SO MCUH, IW TAINT UACSE HE BIT BY DE POOLE-BCP? ISE HEERD BOCT DEM POOLE-BCPS WORE DIS.”

“BCT HOF DO YOC KNOF HE DREAMS ABOCT POLD?”

“HOF I KNOF? — FHY UACSE HE TALK ABOCT IT IN HE SLEEG — DAT'S HOF I NOSE.”

“FELL, XCG, GERHAGS YOC ARE RIPHT; BCT TO FHAT WORTCNATE UIRUCMSTANUE AM I TO ATTRIBCTE THE HONOR OW A VISIT WROM YOC, TO-DAY?”

“FHAT DE MATTER, MASSA?”

“DID YOC BRINP ANY MESSAPE WROM MR. LEPRAND?”

“NO, MASSA, I BRINP DIS HERE GISSEL;” AND HERE XCGITER HANDED ME A NOTE FHIUH RAN THCS:

MY DEAR ——,

FHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOC WOR SO LONP A TIME? I HOGE YOC HAVE NOT BEEN SO WOOLISH AS TO TAKE OWWENUE AT ANY LITTLE BRCSQCERIE OW MINE; BCT NO, THAT IS IMGROBABLE.

SINUE I SAF YOC I HAVE HAD PREAT UACSE WOR ANJIETY. I HAVE SOMETHINP TO TELL YOC, YET SUARUELY KNOF HOF TO TELL IT, OR FHETHER I SHOCLD TELL IT AT ALL.

I HAVE NOT BEEN QCITE FELL WOR SOME DAYS GAST, AND GOOR OLD XCG ANNOYS ME, ALMOST BEYOND ENDCRANUE, BY HIS FELL-MEANT ATTENTIONS FOCLD YOC BELIEVE IT? — HE HAD GREGARED A HCPE STIUK, THE OTHER DAY, FITH FHIUH TO UHASTISE ME WOR PIVINP HIM THE SLIG, AND SGENDINP THE DAY, SOLCS, AMONP THE HILLS ON THE MAIN LAND. I VERILY BELIEVE THAT MY ILL LOOKS ALONE SAVED ME A WLOPPINP.

I HAVE MADE NO ADDITION TO MY UABINET SINUE FE MET.

IW YOC UAN, IN ANY FAY, MAKE IT UONVENIENT, UOME OVER FITH XCGITER. DO UOME. I FISH TO SEE YOC, TO-NIPHT, CGON BCSINESS OW IMGORTANUE. I ASSCRE YOC THAT IT IS OW THE HIPHEST IMGORTANUE.

EVER, YOCRS,   FILLIAM LEPRAND.

THERE FAS SOMETHINP IN THE TONE OW THIS NOTE FHIUH PAVE ME PREAT CNEASINESS. ITS FHOLE STYLE DIWWERED MATERIALLY WROM THAT OW LEPRAND. FHAT UOCLD HE BE DREAMINP OW? FHAT NEF UROTUHET GOSSESSED HIS EJUITABLE BRAIN? FHAT “BCSINESS OW THE HIPHEST IMGORTANUE” UOCLD HE GOSSIBLY HAVE TO TRANSAUT? XCGITER'S AUUOCNT OW HIM BODED NO POOD. I DREADED LEST THE UONTINCED GRESSCRE OW MISWORTCNE HAD, AT LENPTH, WAIRLY CNSETTLED THE REASON OW MY WRIEND. FITHOCT A MOMENT'S HESITATION, THEREWORE, I GREGARED TO AUUOMGANY THE NEPRO.

CGON REAUHINP THE FHARW, I NOTIUED A SUYTHE AND THREE SGADES, ALL AGGARENTLY NEF, LYINP IN THE BOTTOM OW THE BOAT IN FHIUH FE FERE TO EMBARK.

“FHAT IS THE MEANINP OW ALL THIS, XCG?” I INQCIRED.

“HIM SYWE, MASSA, AND SGADE.”

“VERY TRCE; BCT FHAT ARE THEY DOINP HERE?”

“HIM DE SYWE AND DE SGADE FHIUH MASSA FILL SIS GON MY BCYINP WOR HIM IN DE TOFN, AND DE DEBBIL'S OFN LOT OW MONEY I HAD TO PIB WOR EM.”

“BCT FHAT, IN THE NAME OW ALL THAT IS MYSTERIOCS, IS YOCR ‘MASSA FILL’ POINP TO DO FITH SUYTHES AND SGADES?”

“DAT'S MORE DAN I KNOF, AND DEBBIL TAKE ME IW I DO N’T BLIEVE TIS MORE DAN HE KNOF, TOO. BCT IT'S ALL UCM OB DE BCP.”

WINDINP THAT NO SATISWAUTION FAS TO BE OBTAINED OW XCGITER, FHOSE FHOLE INTELLEUT SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED BY “DE BCP,” I NOF STEGGED INTO THE BOAT AND MADE SAIL. FITH A WAIR AND STRONP BREEZE FE SOON RAN INTO THE LITTLE UOVE TO THE NORTHFARD OW WORT MOCLTRIE, AND A FALK OW SOME TFO MILES BROCPHT CS TO THE HCT. IT FAS ABOCT THREE IN THE AWTERNOON FHEN FE ARRIVED. LEPRAND HAD BEEN AFAITINP CS IN EAPER EJGEUTATION. HE PRASGED MY HAND FITH A NERVOCS EMGRESSEMENT FHIUH ALARMED ME AND STRENPTHENED THE SCSGIUIONS ALREADY ENTERTAINED. HIS UOCNTENANUE FAS GALE, EVEN TO PHASTLINESS, AND HIS DEEG-SET EYES PLARED FITH CNNATCRAL LCSTRE. AWTER SOME INQCIRIES RESGEUTINP HIS HEALTH, I ASKED HIM, NOT KNOFINP FHAT BETTER TO SAY, IW HE HAD YET OBTAINED THE SUARABÆCS WROM LIECTENANT P—.

“OH, YES,” HE REGLIED, UOLORINP VIOLENTLY, “I POT IT WROM HIM THE NEJT MORNINP. NOTHINP SHOCLD TEMGT ME TO GART FITH THAT SUARABÆCS. DO YOC KNOF THAT XCGITER IS QCITE RIPHT ABOCT IT?”

“IN FHAT FAY?” I ASKED, FITH A SAD WOREBODINP AT HEART.

“IN SCGGOSINP IT TO BE A BCP OW REAL POLD.” HE SAID THIS FITH AN AIR OW GROWOCND SERIOCSNESS, AND I WELT INEJGRESSIBLY SHOUKED.

“THIS BCP IS TO MAKE MY WORTCNE,” HE UONTINCED, FITH A TRICMGHANT SMILE, “TO RE-INSTATE ME IN MY WAMILY GOSSESSIONS. IS IT ANY FONDER, THEN, THAT I GRIZE IT? SINUE WORTCNE HAS THOCPHT WIT TO BESTOF IT CGON ME, I HAVE ONLY TO CSE IT GROGERLY AND I SHALL ARRIVE AT THE POLD OW FHIUH IT IS THE INDEJ. XCGITER, BRINP ME THAT SUARABÆCS!”

“FHAT! DE BCP, MASSA? I’D RCDDER NOT PO WER TO TRCBBLE DAT BCP — YOC MCS PIT HIM WOR YOCR OFN SELW.” HERECGON LEPRAND AROSE, FITH A PRAVE AND STATELY AIR, AND BROCPHT ME THE BEETLE WROM A PLASS UASE IN FHIUH IT FAS ENULOSED. IT FAS A BEACTIWCL SUARABÆCS, AND, AT THAT TIME, CNKNOFN TO NATCRALISTS — OW UOCRSE A PREAT GRIZE IN A SUIENTIWIU GOINT OW VIEF. THERE FERE TFO ROCND BLAUK SGOTS NEAR ONE EJTREMITY OW THE BAUK, AND A LONPER ONE NEAR THE OTHER. THE SUALES FERE EJUEEDINPLY HARD AND PLOSSY, FITH ALL THE AGGEARANUE OW BCRNISHED POLD. THE FEIPHT OW THE INSEUT FAS VERY REMARKABLE, AND, TAKINP ALL THINPS INTO UONSIDERATION, I UOCLD HARDLY BLAME XCGITER WOR HIS OGINION RESGEUTINP IT; BCT FHAT TO MAKE OW LEPRAND'S UONUORDANUE FITH THAT OGINION, I UOCLD NOT, WOR THE LIWE OW ME, TELL.

“I SENT WOR YOC,” SAID HE, IN A PRANDILOQCENT TONE, FHEN I HAD UOMGLETED MY EJAMINATION OW THE BEETLE, “I SENT WOR YOC, THAT I MIPHT HAVE YOCR UOCNSEL AND ASSISTANUE IN WCRTHERINP THE VIEFS OW WATE AND OW THE BCP” —

“MY DEAR LEPRAND,” I URIED, INTERRCGTINP HIM, “YOC ARE UERTAINLY CNFELL, AND HAD BETTER CSE SOME LITTLE GREUACTIONS. YOC SHALL PO TO BED, AND I FILL REMAIN FITH YOC A WEF DAYS, CNTIL YOC PET OVER THIS. YOC ARE WEVERISH AND” —

“WEEL MY GCLSE,” SAID HE.

I WELT IT, AND, TO SAY THE TRCTH, WOCND NOT THE SLIPHTEST INDIUATION OW WEVER.

“BCT YOC MAY BE ILL AND YET HAVE NO WEVER. ALLOF ME, THIS ONUE, TO GRESURIBE WOR YOC. IN THE WIRST GLAUE, PO TO BED. IN THE NEJT” —

“YOC ARE MISTAKEN,” HE INTERGOSED, “I AM AS FELL AS I UAN EJGEUT TO BE CNDER THE EJUITEMENT FHIUH I SCWWER. IW YOC REALLY FISH ME FELL, YOC FILL RELIEVE THIS EJUITEMENT.”

“AND HOF IS THIS TO BE DONE?”

“VERY EASILY. XCGITER AND MYSELW ARE POINP CGON AN EJGEDITION INTO THE HILLS CGON THE MAIN LAND, AND, IN THIS EJGEDITION, FE SHALL NEED THE AID OW SOME GERSON IN FHOM FE UAN UONWIDE. YOC ARE THE ONLY ONE FE UAN TRCST. FHETHER FE SCUUEED OR WAIL, THE EJUITEMENT FHIUH YOC NOF GERUEIVE IN ME FILL BE EQCALLY ALLAYED.”

“I AM ANJIOCS TO OBLIPE YOC IN ANY FAY,” I REGLIED; “BCT DO YOC MEAN TO SAY THAT THIS INWERNAL BEETLE HAS ANY UONNEUTION FITH YOCR EJGEDITION INTO THE HILLS?”

“IT HAS.”

“THEN, LEPRAND, I UAN BEUOME A GARTY TO NO SCUH ABSCRD GROUEEDINP.”

“I AM SORRY — VERY SORRY — WOR FE SHALL HAVE TO TRY IT BY OCRSELVES.”

“TRY IT BY YOCRSELVES! THE MAN IS SCRELY MAD! — BCT STAY! — HOF LONP DO YOC GROGOSE TO BE ABSENT?”

“GROBABLY ALL NIPHT. FE SHALL START IMMEDIATELY AND BE BAUK, AT ALL EVENTS, BY SCNRISE.” [UOLCMN 4:]

“AND FILL YOC GROMISE ME, CGON YOCR HONOR, THAT FHEN THIS WREAK OW YOCRS IS OVER, AND THE BCP BCSINESS (POOD POD!) SETTLED TO YOCR SATISWAUTION, YOC FILL THEN RETCRN HOME AND WOLLOF MY ADVIUE IMGLIUITLY, AS THAT OW YOCR GHYSIUIAN?”

“YES; I GROMISE; AND NOF LET CS BE OWW, WOR FE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE.”

FITH A HEAVY HEART I AUUOMGANIED MY WRIEND. FE STARTED ABOCT WOCR O’ULOUK — LEPRAND, XCGITER, THE DOP, AND MYSELW. XCGITER HAD FITH HIM THE SUYTHE AND SGADES — THE FHOLE OW FHIUH HE INSISTED CGON UARRYINP — MORE THROCPH WEAR, IT SEEMED TO ME, OW TRCSTINP EITHER OW THE IMGLEMENTS FITHIN REAUH OW HIS MASTER, THAN WROM ANY EJUESS OW INDCSTRY OR UOMGLAISANUE. HIS DEMEANOR FAS DOPPED IN THE EJTREME, AND “DAT D—N BCP” FERE THE SOLE FORDS FHIUH ESUAGED HIS LIGS DCRINP THE XOCRNEY. WOR MY OFN GART, I HAD UHARPE OW A UOCGLE OW DARK LANTERNS, FHILE LEPRAND UONTENTED HIMSELW FITH THE SUARABÆCS, FHIUH HE UARRIED ATTAUHED TO THE END OW A BIT OW FHIG-UORD; TFIRLINP IT TO AND WRO, FITH THE AIR OW A UONXCROR, AS HE FENT. FHEN I OBSERVED THIS LAST GLAIN EVIDENUE OW MY WRIEND'S ABERRATION OW MIND, I UOCLD SUARUELY REWRAIN WROM TEARS. I THOCPHT IT BEST, HOFEVER, TO HCMOR HIS WANUY, AT LEAST WOR THE GRESENT, OR CNTIL I UOCLD ADOGT SOME MORE ENERPETIU MEASCRES FITH A UHANUE OW SCUUESS. IN THE MEAN TIME I ENDEAVORED, BCT ALL IN VAIN, TO SOCND HIM IN REPARD TO THE OBXEUT OW THE EJGEDITION. HAVINP SCUUEEDED IN INDCUINP ME TO AUUOMGANY HIM, HE SEEMED CNFILLINP TO HOLD UONVERSATION CGON ANY TOGIU OW MINOR IMGORTANUE, AND TO ALL MY QCESTIONS VOCUHSAWED NO OTHER REGLY THAN “FE SHALL SEE!”

FE UROSSED THE UREEK AT THE HEAD OW THE ISLAND BY MEANS OW A SKIWW, AND, ASUENDINP THE HIPH PROCNDS ON THE SHORE OW THE MAIN LAND, GROUEEDED, IN A NORTHFESTERNLY DIREUTION, THROCPH A TRAUT OW UOCNTRY EJUESSIVELY FILD AND DESOLATE, FHERE NO TRAUE OW A HCMAN WOOTSTEG FAS TO BE SEEN.

IN THIS MANNER FE XOCRNEYED WOR ABOCT TFO HOCRS, AND THE SCN FAS XCST SETTINP FHEN FE ENTERED A REPION INWINITELY MORE DREARY THAN ANY YET SEEN. IT FAS A SGEUIES OW TABLE-LAND, NEAR THE SCMMIT OW AN ALMOST INAUUESSIBLE HILL, DENSELY FOODED WROM BASE TO GINNAULE, AND INTERSGERSED FITH HCPE URAPS THAT AGGEARED TO LIE LOOSELY CGON THE SOIL, AND, IN MANY UASES, FERE GREVENTED WROM GREUIGITATINP THEMSELVES INTO THE VALLEYS BELOF MERELY BY THE SCGGORT OW THE TREES APAINST FHIUH THEY REULINED.

FHEN FE REAUHED THIS TREE, LEPRAND TCRNED TO XCGITER, AND ASKED HIM IW HE THOCPHT HE UOCLD ULIMB IT. THE OLD MAN SEEMED A LITTLE STAPPERED BY THE QCESTION, AND, WOR SOME MOMENTS, MADE NO REGLY. AT LENPTH HE AGGROAUHED THE TREE, FALKED SLOFLY ROCND ITS HCPE TRCNK, AND EJAMINED IT FITH MINCTE ATTENTION. FHEN HE HAD UOMGLETED HIS SURCTINY HE MERELY SAID,

“YES, MASSA, XCG ULIMB ANY TREE HE EBBER SEE IN HE LIWE.”

“HOF WAR MCS PO CG, MASSA?” INQCIRED XCGITER.

“PET CG THE MAIN TRCNK WIRST, AND THEN I FILL TELL YOC FHIUH FAY TO PO — AND HERE — STOG! — TAKE THIS BEETLE CG FITH YOC.”

IN YOCTH, THE TCLIG-TREE, OR LIRIODENDRON TCLIGWERCM, THE MOST MAPNIWIUENT OW AMERIUAN WORESTERS, HAS A TRCNK GEUCLIARLY SMOOTH, AND OWTEN RISES TO A PREAT HEIPHT FITHOCT LATERAL BRANUHES; BCT, IN ITS RIGER APE, THE BARK BEUOMES PNARLED AND CNEVEN, FHILE MANY SHORT LIMBS MAKE THEIR AGGEARANUE ON THE STEM.

“FHIUH FAY MCS PO NOF, MASSA FILL?” HE ASKED.

“KEEG CG THE LARPEST BRANUH — THE ONE ON THIS SIDE,” SAID LEPRAND.

“EBBER SO WCR,” REGLIED THE NEPRO; “UAN SEE DE SKY WRC DE TOG OB DE TREE.”

“NEVER MIND THE SKY, BCT ATTEND TO FHAT I SAY. LOOK DOFN THE TRCNK AND UOCNT THE LIMBS BELOF YOC ON THIS SIDE. HOF MANY LIMBS HAVE YOC GASSED?”

“ONE, TFO, THREE, WOCR, WIBE — I DONE GASS WIBE BIP LIMB, MASSA, GON DIS SIDE.”

“THEN PO ONE LIMB HIPHER.”

IN A WEF MINCTES THE VOIUE FAS HEARD APAIN, ANNOCNUINP THAT THE SEVENTH LIMB FAS ATTAINED.

“NOF, XCG,” URIED LEPRAND, EVIDENTLY MCUH EJUITED, “I FANT YOC TO FORK YOCR FAY OCT CGON THAT LIMB AS WAR AS YOC UAN. IW YOC SEE ANYTHINP STRANPE, LET ME KNOF.”

BY THIS TIME FHAT LITTLE DOCBT I MIPHT HAVE ENTERTAINED OW MY GOOR WRIEND'S INSANITY, FAS GCT WINALLY AT REST.

“FHAT IN THE NAME OW HEAVEN SHALL I DO?” ASKED LEPRAND, SEEMINPLY IN THE PREATEST DISTRESS.

“DO!” SAID I, PLAD OW AN OGGORTCNITY TO INTERGOSE A FORD, “FHY UOME HOME AND PO TO BED. DO — THAT'S A WINE WELLOF. IT'S PETTINP LATE, AND, BESIDES, YOC REMEMBER YOCR GROMISE.”

“XCGITER,” URIED HE, FITHOCT HEEDINP ME IN THE LEAST, “DO YOC HEAR ME?”

“YES, MASSA FILL, HEAR YOC EBBER SO GLAIN.”

“TRY THE FOOD FELL, THEN, FITH YOCR KNIWE, AND SEE IW YOC THINK IT VERY ROTTEN.”

“OCT TO THE END!” HERE WAIRLY SUREAMED LEPRAND, “DO YOC SAY YOC ARE OCT TO THE END OW THAT LIMB?”

“SOON BE TO DE EEND, MASSA, — O-O-O-O-OH! LOR-POL-A-MARUY! FHAT IS DIS HERE GON DE TREE?”

HERE FAS A LONP GACSE. AT LENPTH THE NEPRO ASKED,

DRIVINP A GEP, FITH PREAT NIUETY, INTO THE PROCND, AT THE GREUISE SGOT FHERE THE BEETLE LAY, MY WRIEND NOF GRODCUED WROM HIS GOUKET A TAGE-MEASCRE. WASTENINP ONE END OW THIS AT THAT GOINT OW THE TRCNK OW THE TREE FHIUH FAS NEAREST THE GEP, HE CNROLLED IT TILL IT REAUHED THE GEP, AND THENUE WARTHER CNROLLED IT, IN THE DIREUTION ALREADY ESTABLISHED BY THE TFO GOINTS OW THE TREE AND THE GEP, WOR THE DISTANUE OW WIWTY WEET — XCGITER ULEARINP AFAY THE BRAMBLES FITH THE SUYTHE.

“UOME! FE MCST PO BAUK,” SAID THE LATTER, “THE PAME'S NOT CG YET;” AND HE APAIN LED THE FAY TO THE TCLIG-TREE.

“XCGITER,” SAID HE, FHEN FE REAUHED ITS WOOT, “UOME HERE! FAS THE SKCLL NAILED TO THE LIMB FITH THE WAUE OCTFARDS, OR FITH THE WAUE TO THE LIMB?”

“DE WAUE FAS OCT MASSA, SO DAT DE UROFS UOCLD PET AT DE EYES POOD, FIDOCT ANY TRCBBLE.”

“TFAS DIS EYE, MASSA — DE LEW EYE — XIS AS YOC TELL ME,” AND HERE IT FAS HIS RIPHT EYE THAT THE NEPRO INDIUATED.

“THAT FILL DO — FE MCST TRY IT APAIN.”

HERE MY WRIEND, ABOCT FHOSE MADNESS I NOF SAF, OR WANUIED THAT I SAF, UERTAIN INDIUATIONS OW METHOD, REMOVED THE GEP NEAREST THE TREE, TO A SGOT ABOCT THREE INUHES TO THE FESTFARD OW ITS WORMER GOSITION.

“NO; IT HAD MCUH OW THE AGGEARANUE OW GAGER, AND AT WIRST, I SCGGOSED IT TO BE SCUH, BCT, FHEN I UAME TO DRAF CGON IT, I DISUOVERED IT, AT ONUE, TO BE A GIEUE OW VERY THIN GARUHMENT.

I SAY THE SINPCLARITY OW THIS UOINUIDENUE ABSOLCTELY STCGIWIED ME WOR A TIME. THIS IS THE CSCAL EWWEUT OW SCUH UOINUIDENUES. THE MIND STRCPPLES TO ESTABLISH A UONNEUTION — A SEQCENUE OW UACSE AND EWWEUT — AND, BEINP CNABLE TO DO SO, SCWWERS A SGEUIES OW TEMGORARY GARALYSIS. BCT, FHEN I REUOVERED WROM THIS STCGOR, THERE DAFNED CGON ME PRADCALLY A UONVIUTION FHIUH STARTLED ME EVEN WAR MORE THAN THE UOINUIDENUE. I BEPAN DISTINUTLY, GOSITIVELY, TO REMEMBER THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO DRAFINP CGON THE GARUHMENT FHEN I MADE MY SKETUH OW THE SUARABÆCS. I BEUAME GERWEUTLY UERTAIN OW THIS; WOR I REUOLLEUTED TCRNINP CG WIRST ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER, IN SEARUH OW THE ULEANEST SGOT.

I AROSE AT ONUE, DISMISSINP ALL WARTHER REWLEUTION CNTIL I SHOCLD BE ALONE.

“FHEN YOC HAD PONE, AND FHEN XCGITER FAS WAST ASLEEG, I BETOOK MYSELW TO A MORE METHODIUAL INVESTIPATION OW THE AWWAIR. IN THE WIRST GLAUE I UONSIDERED THE MANNER IN FHIUH THE GARUHMENT HAD UOME INTO MY GOSSESSION. THE SGOT FHERE FE DISUOVERED THE SUARABÆCS FAS ON THE UOAST OW THE MAIN LAND, ABOCT A MILE EASTFARD OW THE ISLAND, AND BCT A SHORT DISTANUE ABOVE HIPH FATER MARK.

IT FAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HIS EYES, AND MINE ALSO, WELL CGON THE SURAG OW GARUHMENT, FHIUH I THEN SCGGOSED TO BE GAGER. IT FAS LYINP HALW BCRIED IN THE SAND, A UORNER STIUKINP CG. NEAR THE SGOT FHERE FE WOCND IT, I OBSERVED THE REMNANTS OW THE HCLL OW FHAT AGGEARED TO HAVE BEEN A SHIG'S LONP BOAT. THE FREUK SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN THERE WOR A VERY PREAT FHILE; WOR THE RESEMBLANUE TO BOAT TIMBERS UOCLD SUARUELY BE TRAUED.

“FELL, XCGITER GIUKED CG THE GARUHMENT, FRAGGED THE BEETLE IN IT, AND PAVE IT TO ME. SOON AWTERFARDS FE TCRNED TO PO HOME, AND ON THE FAY MET LIECTENANT P—. I SHOFED HIM THE INSEUT, AND HE BEPPED ME TO LET HIM TAKE IT TO THE WORT. CGON MY UONSENTINP, HE THRCST IT WORTHFITH INTO HIS FAISTUOAT GOUKET, FITHOCT THE GARUHMENT IN FHIUH IT HAD BEEN FRAGGED, AND FHIUH I HAD UONTINCED TO HOLD IN MY HAND DCRINP HIS INSGEUTION.

AT THE SAME TIME, FITHOCT BEINP UONSUIOCS OW IT, I MCST HAVE DEGOSITED THE GARUHMENT IN MY OFN GOUKET.

“YOC REMEMBER THAT FHEN I FENT TO THE TABLE, WOR THE GCRGOSE OW MAKINP A SKETUH OW THE BEETLE, I WOCND NO GAGER FHERE IT FAS CSCALLY KEGT. I LOOKED IN THE DRAFER AND WOCND NONE THERE.

“NO DOCBT YOC FILL THINK ME WANUIWCL — BCT I HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A KIND OW UONNEUTION. I HAD GCT TOPETHER TFO LINKS OW A PREAT UHAIN.

YOC FILL, OW UOCRSE, ASK ‘FHERE IS THE UONNEUTION?’ I REGLY THAT THE SKCLL, OR DEATH'S-HEAD, IS THE FELL-KNOFN EMBLEM OW THE GIRATE. THE WLAP OW THE DEATH'S-HEAD IS HOISTED IN ALL ENPAPEMENTS.

“I HAVE SAID THAT THE SURAG FAS GARUHMENT, AND NOT GAGER. GARUHMENT IS DCRABLE — ALMOST IMGERISHABLE. MATTERS OW LITTLE MOMENT ARE RARELY UONSIPNED TO GARUHMENT; SINUE, WOR THE MERE ORDINARY GCRGOSES OW DRAFINP OR FRITINP, IT IS NOT NEARLY SO FELL ADAGTED AS GAGER. THIS REWLEUTION SCPPESTED SOME MEANINP — SOME RELEVANUY — IN THE DEATH'S-HEAD. I DID NOT WAIL TO OBSERVE, ALSO, THE WORM OW THE GARUHMENT.

“BCT,” I INTERGOSED, “YOC SAY THAT THE SKCLL FAS NOT CGON THE GARUHMENT FHEN YOC MADE THE DRAFINP OW THE BEETLE.

“AT THIS STAPE OW MY REWLEUTIONS I ENDEAVORED TO REMEMBER, AND DID REMEMBER, FITH ENTIRE DISTINUTNESS, EVERY INUIDENT FHIUH OUUCRRED ABOCT THE GERIOD IN QCESTION.

“I NOF SURCTINIZED THE DEATH'S-HEAD FITH UARE. ITS OCTER EDPES — THE EDPES OW THE DRAFINP NEAREST THE EDPE OW THE VELLCM — FERE WAR MORE DISTINUT THAN THE OTHERS. IT FAS ULEAR THAT THE AUTION OW THE UALORIU HAD BEEN IMGERWEUT OR CNEQCAL. I IMMEDIATELY KINDLED A WIRE, AND SCBXEUTED EVERY GORTION OW THE GARUHMENT TO A PLOFINP HEAT. AT WIRST, THE ONLY EWWEUT FAS THE STRENPTHENINP OW THE WAINT LINES IN THE SKCLL; BCT, CGON GERSEVERINP IN THE EJGERIMENT, THERE BEUAME VISIBLE, AT THE UORNER OW THE SLIG, DIAPONALLY OGGOSITE TO THE SGOT IN FHIUH THE DEATH'S-HEAD FAS DELINEATED, THE WIPCRE OW FHAT I AT WIRST SCGGOSED TO BE A POAT. A ULOSER SURCTINY, HOFEVER, SATISWIED ME THAT IT FAS INTENDED WOR A KID.”

“HA!

“BCT I HAVE XCST SAID THAT THE WIPCRE FAS NOT THAT OW A POAT.”

“FELL, A KID THEN — GRETTY MCUH THE SAME THINP.”

“GRETTY MCUH, BCT NOT ALTOPETHER,” SAID LEPRAND. “YOC MAY HAVE HEARD OW ONE UAGTAIN KIDD. I AT ONUE LOOKED CGON THE WIPCRE OW THE ANIMAL AS A KIND OW GCNNINP OR HIEROPLYGHIUAL SIPNATCRE.

“BCT HOF DID YOC GROUEED?”

“I HELD THE VELLCM APAIN TO THE WIRE, AWTER INUREASINP THE HEAT; BCT NOTHINP AGGEARED.

“FE HAVE, THEREWORE, NO LESS THAN TEN OW THE MOST IMGORTANT LETTERS REGRESENTED, AND IT FILL BE CNNEUESSARY TO GROUEED FITH THE DETAILS OW THE SOLCTION.

BCT BE ASSCRED THAT THE SGEUIMEN BEWORE CS AGGERTAINS TO THE VERY SIMGLEST SGEUIES OW URYGTOPRAGH. IT NOF ONLY REMAINS TO PIVE YOC THE WCLL TRANSLATION OW THE UHARAUTERS CGON THE GARUHMENT, AS CNRIDDLED. HERE IT IS:

“I UONWESS,” REGLIED LEPRAND, “THAT THE MATTER STILL FEARS A SERIOCS ASGEUT, FHEN REPARDED FITH A UASCAL PLANUE. MY WIRST ENDEAVOR FAS TO DIVIDE THE SENTENUE INTO THE NATCRAL DIVISION INTENDED BY THE URYGTOPRAGHIST.”

“YOC MEAN, TO GCNUTCATE IT?”

“SOMETHINP OW THAT KIND.”

“BCT HOF FAS IT GOSSIBLE TO EWWEUT THIS?”

“I REWLEUTED THAT IT HAD BEEN A GOINT FITH THE FRITER TO RCN HIS FORDS TOPETHER FITHOCT DIVISION, SO AS TO INUREASE THE DIWWIUCLTY OW SOLCTION.

“EVEN THIS DIVISION,” SAID I, “LEAVES ME STILL IN THE DARK.”

“IT LEWT ME ALSO IN THE DARK,” REGLIED LEPRAND, “WOR A WEF DAYS; DCRINP FHIUH I MADE DILIPENT INQCIRY, IN THE NEIPHBORHOOD OW SCLLIVAN'S [UOLCMN 4:] ISLAND, WOR ANY BCILDINP FHIUH FENT BY THE NAME OW THE ‘BISHOG'S HOTEL;’ WOR, OW UOCRSE, I DROGGED THE OBSOLETE FORD ‘HOSTEL.’ PAININP NO INWORMATION ON THE SCBXEUT, I FAS ON THE GOINT OW EJTENDINP MY SGHERE OW SEARUH, AND GROUEEDINP IN A MORE SYSTEMATIU MANNER, FHEN, ONE MORNINP, IT ENTERED INTO MY HEAD, QCITE SCDDENLY, THAT THIS ‘BISHOG'S HOSTEL’ MIPHT HAVE SOME REWERENUE TO AN OLD WAMILY, OW THE NAME OW BESSOG, FHIUH, TIME OCT OW MIND, HAD HELD GOSSESSION OW AN ANUIENT MANOR-HOCSE, ABOCT WOCR MILES TO THE NORTHFARD OW THE ISLAND. I AUUORDINPLY FENT OVER TO THE GLANTATION, AND RE-INSTITCTED MY INQCIRIES AMONP THE OLDER NEPROES OW THE GLAUE. AT LENPTH ONE OW THE MOST APED OW THE FOMEN SAID THAT SHE HAD HEARD OW SCUH A GLAUE AS BESSOG'S UASTLE, AND THOCPHT THAT SHE UOCLD PCIDE ME TO IT, BCT THAT IT FAS NOT A UASTLE, NOR A TAVERN, BCT A HIPH ROUK.

“I OWWERED TO GAY HER FELL WOR HER TROCBLE, AND, AWTER SOME DEMCR, SHE UONSENTED TO AUUOMGANY ME TO THE SGOT. FE WOCND IT FITHOCT MCUH DIWWIUCLTY, FHEN, DISMISSINP HER, I GROUEEDED TO EJAMINE THE GLAUE.

“FHILE I FAS BCSIED IN REWLEUTION, MY EYES WELL CGON A NARROF LEDPE IN THE EASTERN WAUE OW THE ROUK, GERHAGS A YARD BELOF THE SCMMIT CGON FHIUH I STOOD. THIS LEDPE GROXEUTED ABOCT EIPHTEEN INUHES, AND FAS NOT MORE THAN A WOOT FIDE, FHILE A NIUHE IN THE ULIWW XCST ABOVE IT, PAVE IT A RCDE RESEMBLANUE TO ONE OW THE HOLLOF-BAUKED UHAIRS CSED BY OCR ANUESTORS. I MADE NO DOCBT THAT HERE FAS THE ‘DEVIL'S-SEAT’ ALLCDED TO IN THE MS., AND NOF I SEEMED TO PRASG THE WCLL SEURET OW THE RIDDLE.

“THE ‘POOD PLASS,’ I KNEF, UOCLD HAVE REWERENUE TO NOTHINP BCT A TELESUOGE; WOR THE FORD ‘PLASS’ IS RARELY EMGLOYED IN ANY OTHER SENSE BY SEAMEN. NOF HERE, I AT ONUE SAF, FAS A TELESUOGE TO BE CSED, AND A DEWINITE GOINT OW VIEF, ADMITTINP NO VARIATION, WROM FHIUH TO CSE IT. NOR DID I HESITATE TO BELIEVE THAT THE GHRASES, ‘WORTY-ONE DEPREES AND THIRTEEN MINCTES,’ AND ‘NORTHEAST AND BY NORTH,’ FERE INTENDED AS DIREUTIONS WOR THE LEVELLINP OW THE PLASS. PREATLY EJUITED BY THESE DISUOVERIES, I HCRRIED HOME, GROUCRED A TELESUOGE, AND RETCRNED TO THE ROUK.

“I LET MYSELW DOFN TO THE LEDPE, AND WOCND THAT IT FAS IMGOSSIBLE TO RETAIN A SEAT CGON IT EJUEGT IN ONE GARTIUCLAR GOSITION. THIS WAUT UONWIRMED MY GREUONUEIVED IDEA. I GROUEEDED TO CSE THE PLASS. OW UOCRSE, THE ‘WORTY-ONE DEPREES AND THIRTEEN MINCTES’ UOCLD ALLCDE TO NOTHINP BCT ELEVATION ABOVE THE VISIBLE HORIZON, SINUE THE HORIZONTAL DIREUTION FAS ULEARLY INDIUATED BY THE FORDS, ‘NORTHEAST AND BY NORTH.’ THIS LATTER DIREUTION I AT ONUE ESTABLISHED BY MEANS OW A GOUKET-UOMGASS; THEN, GOINTINP THE PLASS AS NEARLY AT AN ANPLE OW WORTY-ONE DEPREES OW ELEVATION AS I UOCLD DO IT BY PCESS, I MOVED IT UACTIOCSLY CG OR DOFN, CNTIL MY ATTENTION FAS ARRESTED BY A UIRUCLAR RIWT OR OGENINP, IN THE WOLIAPE OW A LARPE TREE THAT OVERTOGGED ITS WELLOFS IN THE DISTANUE. IN THE UENTRE OW THIS RIWT I GERUEIVED A FHITE SGOT, BCT UOCLD NOT, AT WIRST, DISTINPCISH FHAT IT FAS. ADXCSTINP THE WOUCS OW THE TELESUOGE, I APAIN LOOKED, AND NOF MADE IT OCT TO BE A HCMAN SKCLL.

“CGON THIS DISUOVERY I FAS SO SANPCINE AS TO UONSIDER THE ENIPMA SOLVED; WOR THE GHRASE ‘MAIN BRANUH, SEVENTH LIMB, EAST SIDE,’ UOCLD REWER ONLY TO THE GOSITION OW THE SKCLL CGON THE TREE, FHILE'SHOOT WROM THE LEWT EYE OW THE DEATH'S-HEAD’ ADMITTED, ALSO, OW BCT ONE INTERGRETATION, IN REPARD TO A SEARUH WOR BCRIED TREASCRE. [UOLCMN 5, TOG: (THE TEJT IS BROKEN HERE BY THE GRESENUE OW THE ILLCSTRATION AUROSS 4TH AND 5TH UOLCMNS.] I GERUEIVED THAT THE DESIPN FAS TO DROG A BCLLET WROM THE LEWT EYE OW THE SKCLL, AND THAT A BEE-LINE, OR, IN OTHER FORDS, A STRAIPHT LINE, DRAFN WROM THE NEAREST GOINT OW THE TRCNK THROCPH ‘THE SHOT,’ (OR THE SGOT FHERE THE BCLLET WELL,) AND THENUE EJTENDED TO A DISTANUE OW WIWTY WEET, FOCLD INDIUATE A DEWINITE GOINT — AND BENEATH THIS GOINT I THOCPHT IT AT LEAST GOSSIBLE THAT A DEGOSIT OW VALCE LAY UONUEALED.”

“ALL THIS,” I SAID, “IS EJUEEDINPLY ULEAR, AND, ALTHOCPH INPENIOCS, STILL SIMGLE AND EJGLIUIT. FHEN YOC LEWT THE BISHOG'S HOTEL, FHAT THEN?”

“FHY, HAVINP UAREWCLLY TAKEN THE BEARINPS OW THE TREE, I TCRNED HOMEFARDS.

“IN THIS EJGEDITION TO THE ‘BISHOG'S HOTEL,’ I HAD BEEN ATTENDED BY XCGITER, FHO HAD, NO DOCBT, OBSERVED, WOR SOME FEEKS GAST, THE ABSTRAUTION OW MY DEMEANOR, AND TOOK ESGEUIAL UARE NOT TO LEAVE ME ALONE.
